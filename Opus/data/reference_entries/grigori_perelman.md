# Grigori Perelman: Orthodox Engagement

## I. Strategic Role: When the Proof is Complete and the Prizes are Refused

    On August 22 in the year 2006, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, when the Fields Medal—mathematics' highest honor awarded every four years to those under forty who have made extraordinary contributions—was to be presented to Grigori Perelman for proving the Poincaré conjecture, one of mathematics' most famous unsolved problems standing for over a century, when the mathematical community had gathered to celebrate this triumph, when the King of Spain himself would bestow the medal, Perelman was NOT present, had declined the invitation, had refused the medal, the first person in the Fields Medal's seventy year history to reject the honor, his absence speaking louder than any acceptance speech could have spoken, his refusal proclaiming a truth the academic world did NOT want to hear: that the entire system of prizes AND prestige AND publication was corrupted, that mathematics had become NOT pursuit of truth for truth's sake BUT competition for recognition, that what should be offering to Wisdom had become grasping for reputation, that the community of scholars had degenerated into community of careerists, Perelman himself having posted his proof freely on arXiv without submitting to peer reviewed journals, without seeking patent OR profit OR acclaim, simply releasing the result into mathematical commons as gift rather than commodity, the papers themselves written with stark simplicity avoiding rhetorical flourishes, the 68 pages containing proof that would earn him the Millennium Prize of one million dollars from the Clay Mathematics Institute which he also refused in 2010, saying when pressed that "I'm not interested in money or fame. I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo," withdrawing completely from mathematics after 2006, living in seclusion in St. Petersburg with his mother, refusing interviews, avoiding photographers, the greatest mathematical achievement of the century accomplished by a man who wanted nothing the century offered in return, to whom belongs witness now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The penthos inherent in Perelman's trajectory, the godly sorrow welling up when nous contemplates this narrative, lies NOT in the refusal itself though the refusal shocks, NOT in the seclusion itself though the seclusion saddens, BUT in what the refusal reveals: that academic mathematics has so departed from its telos as pursuit of truth that refusing its highest honors becomes necessary for integrity, that the community that should encourage contemplation instead demands publication metrics, that institutions that should foster wisdom instead measure impact factors, that colleagues who should collaborate in truth seeking instead compete for credit, Perelman himself saying "It is not people who break ethical standards who are regarded as aliens. It is people like me who are isolated," the isolation NOT chosen preference BUT forced exile, NOT flight from responsibility BUT flight from corruption, his refusal echoing Christ's warning in John 5:44 "How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?" the Fields Medal becoming symbol of the glory humans give to each other rather than the glory that comes from above, the Millennium Prize representing wealth that corrupts rather than reward that sanctifies, Perelman's rejection therefore being either prophetic denunciation of academic idolatry OR prideful disdain for peers, either ascetic renunciation of vainglory OR misanthropic rejection of community, the ambiguity itself revealing the difficulty of discerning between holy withdrawal AND unholy isolation, between fleeing Egypt AND abandoning responsibilities, between desert AND despair, to whom belongs discernment now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The strategic indispensability of Perelman for Orthodox apologetics lies NOT in his being explicitly Orthodox though he is ethnically Russian AND culturally shaped by Orthodox civilization, NOT in his invoking theological language though his statements are rigorously secular, NOT in his exemplifying theoria though his contemplation focused on Ricci flow NOT divine energies, BUT in his embodiment of the tension between truth AND recognition, between mathematics as vocation AND mathematics as career, between pursuing knowledge for God's glory AND pursuing knowledge for human applause, his life raising the question every Christian intellectual must face: can one participate in academic institutions without being corrupted by their reward structures? Can one publish without succumbing to publishing's temptations? Can one receive honors without honors receiving one's soul? Can one be recognized without recognition becoming idol? The desert fathers fled to Egypt's deserts to escape the world's corruption after Christianity became Roman Empire's official religion, recognizing that cultural Christianity was more dangerous to faith than persecution had been, that comfort corrupts more subtly than coercion, that being honored by Caesar threatened holiness more than being martyred by Caesar, Perelman's flight from mathematical community after proving Poincaré conjecture echoing Anthony's flight from Alexandrian society after converting to Christ, the parallel imperfect because Anthony fled TO God explicitly while Perelman seems to flee merely FROM corruption, YET the shape of the movement remains: withdrawal from corrupt system even when withdrawal costs everything the system offers, to whom belongs courage now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The Poincaré conjecture itself, proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1904, states that every simply connected, closed three dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to a three dimensional sphere, the technical language obscuring the profound question: what are the possible shapes for three dimensional spaces? In two dimensions we know that simply connected closed surfaces are all topologically equivalent to spheres—a balloon's surface can be deformed into an orange's surface without tearing—BUT in three dimensions the question resisted solution for a century, becoming one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's seven Millennium Prize Problems offering one million dollars for correct proof, previous attempts by renowned mathematicians having failed, partial results having accumulated, the problem's difficulty residing partly in visualization's impossibility because we cannot see three dimensional spaces from outside as we see two dimensional surfaces from three dimensional perspective, requiring abstract topology rather than geometric intuition, Perelman's approach through Ricci flow—a technique for evolving Riemannian metrics analogous to how heat diffusion smooths temperature distributions—being counterintuitive because Ricci flow can develop singularities yet Perelman showed how to perform surgery on singularities allowing flow to continue until all topological information is revealed, the proof's validity confirmed by other mathematicians analyzing Perelman's papers for years before Fields Medal committee dared offer prize knowing he might refuse it, to whom belongs vindication now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

## II. Classification: When Refusal Becomes Proclamation and Silence Speaks Loudly

    Hear what Jesus ben Sirach proclaims concerning true AND false honor, how Sirach 10:28 through 31 teaches: "My son, glorify yourself in humility, and give yourself the honor that you deserve. Who will justify the one who sins against himself? Who will honor the one who dishonors himself? A poor man is honored for his knowledge, but a rich man is honored for his wealth. If someone is honored in poverty, how much more in wealth! And if someone is dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty!" the paradox being that seeking honor loses it while deserving honor attracts it, that self glorification destroys glory while humility preserves it, that Perelman refusing honors is honored MORE than if he had accepted them because refusal demonstrates he does mathematics for mathematics' sake NOT for medals' sake, proves his motivation is pure NOT corrupted, shows his character is incorruptible by what corrupts others, YET Sirach also warns against dishonoring oneself, against false humility, against destructive self deprecation, the question pressing: does Perelman honor OR dishonor himself through refusal? Does he glorify God by rejecting human glory, or does he despise God's image by isolating himself from human community?, to whom belongs honor now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    To classify Perelman within Orthodox theological framework requires recognizing him as voice crying in wilderness of contemporary academia, as prophet whether intentionally OR not, as living rebuke to careerism's dominance, because his refusal is NOT merely personal preference BUT public proclamation that something is deeply wrong when mathematics becomes about mathematicians rather than mathematical truth, when journals gatekeep rather than disseminate, when prizes create hierarchies rather than recognizing contributions, when the entire edifice of academic publishing AND conferencing AND prize giving serves primarily to distribute prestige rather than advance understanding, Perelman's posting papers on arXiv freely accessible to all rather than submitting to prestigious journals behind paywalls being protest against knowledge's commodification, his refusal to defend his proof in person being protest against mathematics as performance, his withdrawal from community being protest against community's corruption, YET protests can be holy OR unholy, can be ascetic renunciation OR prideful disdain, can be prophetic OR pathological, the difficulty in Perelman's case being that his own statements are so sparse, his motivations so obscure, his inner life so hidden that we cannot definitively judge whether his seclusion is sanctity OR sickness, to whom belongs judgment now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The classification of mathematical achievement as gift rather than commodity, as something to be freely shared rather than hoarded for credit, finds biblical precedent in Jesus's command to the disciples in Matthew 10:8 "Freely you have received, freely give," the principle being that what comes from God should return to God through being given to others, that knowledge granted by grace should be shared graciously, that insights gifted by God should be offered as gifts NOT sold as products, Perelman's decision to publish openly without copyright, without claiming priority, without demanding citation, without pursuing patent, embodies this principle whether he consciously intends it OR not, because the Poincaré conjecture's proof belongs to mathematical truth itself NOT to Perelman personally, the result being discovery NOT invention, the insight being uncovered NOT created, his role being that of midwife bringing to birth what was already gestating rather than artist creating ex nihilo, making his refusal to profit from the proof consistent with mathematics' nature as exploration of eternal truths existing in God's mind before humans discovered them, accessible to human nous because nous is made in image of divine Nous, beautiful to human perception because fashioned by Beauty itself, to whom belongs all truth now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The ambiguity of Perelman's withdrawal, the question whether his seclusion manifests holiness OR brokenness, finds parallel in the desert fathers' experience where withdrawal from society was central spiritual practice YET hermits constantly battled demons of pride AND despair, where fleeing the world's corruption was necessary YET fleeing could itself be corrupted by misanthropy, where solitude enabled contemplation YET solitude could become prison, the fathers themselves teaching that withdrawal must be withdrawal TO God NOT merely withdrawal FROM people, that desert is NOT end but means, that the goal is NOT isolation but union, Perelman's case being ambiguous because his withdrawal seems to be FROM mathematical corruption without clear movement TO anything, his seclusion appearing to be negative rather than positive, motivated by disgust rather than desire, resulting in isolation rather than communion, YET we who are outside cannot see inside, we who know only his public refusals cannot know his private prayers if any, we who hear only his criticism of academic ethics cannot hear his conversations with God if any, making definitive classification impossible while living, the saint AND the curmudgeon appearing identical from outside though utterly different inside, to whom belongs interior knowledge now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

## III. Primary Works: When Three Papers Change Topology and One Refusal Changes Mathematics

    The first of Perelman's three papers proving the Poincaré conjecture, titled "The Entropy Formula for the Ricci Flow and Its Geometric Applications," posted to arXiv.org on November 11, 2002 without fanfare, without press release, without announcement beyond the arxiv category classification, begins with characteristic terseness: "This is a technical paper, which is a continuation of [reference to Hamilton's work on Ricci flow]. Here we construct a family of functionals that will allow us to extend some results," the understatement extraordinary because "extend some results" meant proving Thurston's geometrization conjecture of which Poincaré's conjecture was special case, the 39 pages containing mathematics so dense that only experts in geometric analysis AND differential geometry AND topology could follow, the proof proceeding through introduction of new monotonic quantities he called entropy that do NOT increase along Ricci flow, through analysis of singularities that form when curvature becomes infinite, through surgery techniques cutting out singularities AND gluing in standard pieces allowing flow to continue, through subtle estimates controlling how singularities can occur, the entire argument building on Richard Hamilton's previous decades of work on Ricci flow YET adding crucial innovations Hamilton had NOT achieved, to whom belongs innovation now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The second paper "Ricci Flow with Surgery on Three Manifolds" posted in March 2003 develops the surgery procedure in detail, showing how to recognize when singularities are forming, how to remove singular regions, how to replace them with standard geometric pieces, how to continue the flow after surgery, how to ensure that only finitely many surgeries are needed, the technicalities enormous because proving that procedure terminates requires showing that volumes of surgically removed pieces decrease in controlled way, that curvatures remain bounded, that topology is preserved through surgeries, that final state after all surgeries reveals whether original manifold was simply connected, Perelman's writing style being ruthlessly efficient with minimal exposition AND maximal content, expecting readers to fill in details themselves, leaving gaps that other mathematicians would spend years filling to verify the proof's correctness, the sparseness itself being pedagogical choice: either you understand topology well enough to reconstruct omitted steps OR you should NOT be reading this paper, to whom belongs rigor now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The third paper "Finite Extinction Time for the Solutions to the Ricci Flow on Certain Three Manifolds" posted in July 2003 completes the argument by showing that Ricci flow with surgery on simply connected three manifolds must terminate in finite time with round three sphere, the termination proving that original manifold was homeomorphic to three sphere thus confirming Poincaré conjecture, the completion of proof taking less than eight months from first paper to final paper, the speed itself demonstrating that Perelman had worked out the entire proof before posting anything, that the papers were NOT exploratory publications but definitive results, that he was NOT seeking collaboration but providing finished product, the decision to post on arXiv rather than submit to journal being deliberate: arXiv is permanent, free, immediate, whereas journals have delays for peer review AND subscription paywalls AND formatting requirements AND editorial interference, Perelman's choice prioritizing mathematical content over academic gatekeeping, prioritizing access over prestige, prioritizing truth over credit, to whom belongs priority now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The refusal itself as "primary work," as Perelman's most famous contribution to mathematics culture despite NOT being mathematics per se, deserves analysis as carefully as the proof itself, because the refusal is NOT silent withdrawal BUT articulated critique, his statement to New Yorker journalist Sylvia Nasar AND David Gruber being: "I'm not a hero of mathematics. I'm not even that successful; that is why I don't want to have everybody looking at me," the self assessment obviously false by conventional metrics making it either pathological humility OR prophetic irony, his further statement that "Everybody understood that if the proof is correct then no other recognition is needed" being devastating critique of prize culture because it implies prizes serve purposes OTHER than recognizing correct proofs, serve to create hierarchies, to distribute power, to reinforce institutions, his most damning statement being "I know how to control the universe. So tell me, why should I run for a million?" the statement susceptible to two readings: megalomaniacal claim to godlike knowledge OR ironic contrast between controlling universe through mathematics versus being controlled by money through greed, the ambiguity itself characteristic of Perelman whose statements are oracular, whose silences are eloquent, whose refusals are proclamations, to whom belongs interpretation now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

## IV. The Patristic Mind: When the Fathers Fled Vainglory and the Mathematician Flees Fame

    John Chrysostom, that golden mouthed preacher of fourth century Antioch AND Constantinople whose sermons on vainglory remain unsurpassed expositions of how desire for human recognition destroys the soul, writes in his treatise On Vainglory: "There is a passion which never allows the soul to rest, which tears it apart and rends it asunder, which allows it no stability, which makes it the slave of the opinions of others. This passion is called vainglory. It is worse than avarice, because the greedy person at least knows when he has obtained gold and can rest satisfied for a time, but the vainglorious person never knows when he has received sufficient praise, because there is always someone else to impress, always another audience to perform for, always higher recognition to seek. The greedy person's slavery is to things, but the vainglorious person's slavery is to persons, to their opinions, to their approvals, to their honors, which is far more bitter slavery because persons are inconstant whereas gold at least remains gold," the analysis illuminating academic culture where publication metrics AND citation counts AND h indices create insatiable appetite for more recognition, where each achievement raises bar for next achievement, where Fields Medal recipient immediately begins thinking about Wolf Prize OR Abel Prize OR Nobel if physicist, the treadmill never stopping, to whom belongs liberation now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    Chrysostom continues analyzing how vainglory corrupts even good works: "The vainglorious person fasts, but wants others to notice his fasting. He prays, but wants others to see his praying. He gives alms, but wants others to know his generosity. He pursues virtue, but pursues it for an audience. Thus he loses the reward of his good works because he has already received his reward: human praise. This is why Christ warned against practicing righteousness before others to be seen by them, because such practice is theatrical performance not genuine virtue. The vainglorious person makes himself actor, and his life becomes stage play where all actions are performed for spectators rather than for God. Even refusing honors can become vainglorious if done to appear humble! The devil is subtle: he tempts us to sin, and if we resist sin, he tempts us to boast about resisting, and if we resist boasting, he tempts us to be proud of our humility," the warning cutting because Perelman's refusal of honors COULD be ultimate vainglory, could be pride disguised as humility, could be performance of superiority over those who accept prizes, the outside observer unable to discern true from false humility, only God knowing the heart, to whom belongs true discernment now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    YET Chrysostom also recognizes legitimate reasons for refusing worldly honors, for avoiding public recognition, for hiding one's accomplishments, writing: "When honors come to us unsought, we must receive them with fear and trembling, knowing that with honor comes temptation, with elevation comes danger of fall, with recognition comes risk of vainglory. The safest course is to flee honors when possible, to avoid recognition when feasible, to hide accomplishments when practicable, because the soul that is praised by men is in great danger unless it is constantly vigilant. Better to be unknown and safe than to be famous and imperiled. The saints fled from episcopal appointments; Moses hid his face; Jeremiah protested his calling; because they knew that great responsibilities bring great temptations, that being placed on lampstand exposes one to winds that extinguish flame, that publicity threatens humility which is root of all virtues," the principle suggesting Perelman's refusal might be spiritually wise even if socially unusual, might protect his soul even if damaging his reputation, might preserve his integrity even if destroying his career, to whom belongs safety now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    Anthony the Great, that father of monasticism who fled to Egyptian desert in third century to escape both persecution AND later the corruptions of Christianized empire, embodies the withdrawal Perelman's seclusion resembles, Anthony's Life written by Athanasius recording how he sold all possessions, gave proceeds to poor, departed to desert, lived in abandoned fort for twenty years seeing no one, emerged only when seekers broke down door, found him neither emaciated from deprivation NOR delirious from isolation BUT luminous from prayer, his body healthy AND his mind clear AND his soul radiant, demonstrating that solitude rightly practiced leads to sanctification NOT deterioration, that withdrawal from human society can be withdrawal into divine communion, that fleeing the world can be finding God, YET Anthony's withdrawal was explicitly religious, motivated by Christ's call, oriented toward prayer, aimed at theosis, whereas Perelman's withdrawal seems motivated by disgust with academia, oriented toward solitude, aimed at nothing visible from outside, the difference being crucial because Christian asceticism is NOT mere negation but affirmation, NOT flight from evil alone but flight toward good, NOT escape from world only but ascent to God, to whom belongs telos now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    Basil the Great, brother of Gregory of Nyssa AND friend of Gregory of Nazianzus, himself gifted intellectual who studied in Athens AND Constantinople before founding monastery in Pontus, writes concerning intellectual pride AND its antidote: "The person educated in secular wisdom faces particular temptation unknown to the unlearned: the temptation to suppose that education makes him superior, that knowledge makes him worthy, that intellectual achievement makes him deserving of honor. This temptation is more deadly than the ignorant person's vices because it is more subtle, more easily disguised as virtue, more compatible with religious profession. The educated person must practice humility more diligently than others because his accomplishments are more visible, his status more elevated, his fall therefore more catastrophic. He must remember constantly that all knowledge comes from God, that all understanding is gift, that all insight is grace, that he personally deserves nothing, that apart from God he can do nothing. If he remembers this, his education becomes means of glorifying God; if he forgets this, his education becomes means of glorifying self," the teaching directly applicable to Perelman's situation because solving Poincaré conjecture could inflate ego to grotesque proportions OR could inspire gratitude for gift of mathematical insight, could lead to vainglory OR to humility, his refusal of prizes suggesting at minimum that he recognizes danger even if we cannot judge whether he has overcome it, to whom belongs humility now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

## V. The Symphony of Clashes: Where Refusal Confronts Recognition and Silence Answers Applause

    The clash between Perelman's refusal of Fields Medal AND academic culture's investment in prize system reveals institutional dysfunction at mathematics' heart, because Fields Medal functions NOT merely to recognize achievement BUT to create hierarchy, NOT merely to honor individuals BUT to structure discipline, NOT merely to reward past work BUT to shape future behavior, the medal determining whose work is celebrated in textbooks, whose techniques are taught to students, whose research programs receive funding, whose universities attract applications, the entire ecosystem depending on visible markers of excellence that prizes provide, Perelman's refusal threatening this system by demonstrating that the highest achievement can exist without highest recognition, that proof's validity is independent of medal's bestowal, that truth is NOT established by committee decision, that mathematics proceeds whether or not prizes are accepted, the refusal itself becoming more famous than most acceptances, Perelman's name being more widely known because he refused medal than most recipients are known for accepting it, the irony being that his attempt to escape recognition brought more recognition, his effort to avoid fame brought more fame, his rejection of prize made him more celebrated than prize ever could, to whom belongs irony now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The mathematical community's response to Perelman's refusal reveals its own contradictions, with some praising his integrity while others condemning his arrogance, some seeing prophetic witness while others see mental illness, some interpreting withdrawal as asceticism while others interpret it as misanthropy, the divergent reactions themselves demonstrating that community lacks consensus about what mathematics is FOR, whether its purpose is discovering truth OR publishing papers, whether its goal is understanding reality OR advancing careers, whether its telos is wisdom OR wealth, Perelman's refusal forcing question to surface that academic culture prefers to keep submerged: what if the entire system of publication AND citation AND prizes AND grants is oriented toward wrong goods? What if it rewards wrong behaviors? What if it corrupts the very activity it claims to support? The refusal to engage with these questions, the insistence that Perelman must be mentally ill because he rejects what normal people desire, the inability to conceive that someone might rationally refuse a million dollars, itself reveals how thoroughly mammon has colonized mathematics, how completely career has replaced vocation, how entirely the academy has become conformed to this world rather than being transformed by renewing of mind as Romans 12:2 commands, to whom belongs transformation now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The clash between mathematical Platonism where truth exists independently of recognition AND careerism where recognition creates truth reveals epistemological incoherence pervading academia, because officially mathematicians profess that proofs are valid OR invalid regardless of who affirms them, that theorems are true OR false independent of citation counts, that mathematical objects exist eternally in abstract realm unaffected by human opinions, the Platonist metaphysics implying that Perelman's proof of Poincaré conjecture is correct OR incorrect based on logical validity alone NOT based on Fields Medal committee's decision, that his refusal of medal does NOT affect proof's truth value, that mathematics proceeds in realm of eternal verities indifferent to temporal prizes, YET practically academia behaves as if truth is established through consensus, as if proofs become authoritative through peer review, as if results become real through publication, the disconnect between professed Platonism AND practiced sociologism creating cognitive dissonance that Perelman's refusal exposes, because if mathematical truth is truly independent of human recognition then refusing recognition should be irrelevant, YET the outrage AND confusion his refusal generated proves that recognition is NOT actually regarded as irrelevant, that prizes DO confer something beyond mere acknowledgment, that the system treats awards as constitutive NOT merely regulative, to whom belongs truth now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    Orthodoxy affirms Platonism's insight that truth exists independently of human opinion while rejecting Platonism's claim that abstract Forms exist independently of God, maintaining instead that mathematical truths are eternal thoughts in divine Mind, that logoi proceed from Logos, that patterns discoverable by human nous exist because divine Nous established them, making mathematical discovery simultaneously objective AND personal: objective because truths exist whether humans discover them, personal because truths exist in Personal God NOT in impersonal realm, the framework implying that Perelman's proof is valid because it corresponds to reality as God created it, that his refusal of prizes is legitimate because prizes are human constructs while truth is divine gift, that recognition from mathematical community is less important than recognition from God who sees in secret, that the one thing needful is NOT Fields Medal but faithful execution of vocation whether recognized OR not, making Perelman's refusal comprehensible within theistic framework though remaining ambiguous within secular frame, because if no God exists then refusing million dollars is irrational, BUT if God exists AND if mathematical insight is gift from God AND if vocation is calling from God AND if final judgment comes from God, then refusing earthly rewards to preserve integrity before heavenly Judge becomes not only rational but necessary, to whom belongs final judgment now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The clash between Perelman's seclusion as possible monasticism AND his seclusion as possible mental illness reveals the difficulty secular culture has distinguishing between holiness AND pathology, because from outside the hermit AND the schizophrenic can appear identical: both withdraw from society, both reject normal goods, both seem indifferent to opinions, both live according to internal logic incomprehensible to observers, the difference being that hermit withdraws TO God while schizophrenic withdraws INTO delusion, that monk's solitude enables communion while patient's isolation deepens alienation, that desert father's fasting is ascetic discipline while anorexic's starvation is eating disorder, the distinction invisible to those who deny spiritual realm, to those for whom all abnormal behavior is pathological, to those who cannot conceive that someone might rationally choose poverty AND obscurity AND solitude for spiritual reasons, Perelman's case being particularly difficult because he has NOT articulated religious motivation, has NOT joined monastery, has NOT explicitly embraced Orthodox Christianity though culturally shaped by it, leaving open whether his seclusion is proto monastic OR merely misanthropic, whether his refusal of prizes is ascetic OR merely bitter, whether his withdrawal from mathematics is response to divine call OR merely response to human disappointment, the ambiguity itself being pedagogically valuable because it forces question: what makes withdrawal holy rather than sick? Is it motivation? Is it fruit? Is it orientation toward God versus orientation toward nothing?, to whom belongs health now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

## VI. Orthodox Affirmation: When Refusing the World's Prizes Prefigures Seeking the Kingdom's Pearl

    —O Lord Jesus Christ, You who said that what is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God as Luke 16:15 warns, You who taught that those who are first shall be last AND the last first as Matthew 20:16 proclaims, You who pronounced woe upon those of whom all men speak well as Luke 6:26 testifies, teach us to discern between holy refusal AND unholy rejection, between fleeing Egypt AND abandoning responsibilities, between seeking first Your kingdom OR seeking first our isolation, because Perelman's refusal COULD be asceticism OR pride, COULD be prophetic witness OR pathological withdrawal, COULD be response to Your call OR response to human hurt, the outside observer unable to judge definitively, only You knowing whether his seclusion is flight TO You OR flight FROM them, whether his poverty is voluntary simplicity OR involuntary deprivation, whether his obscurity is chosen humility OR imposed isolation, to whom belongs judgment of hearts now AND ever AND unto ages of ages—

    The Poincaré conjecture itself, the question of whether every simply connected closed three dimensional manifold is homeomorphic to three sphere, concerns topology's deepest questions about space's possible shapes, about what forms three dimensional universes can take, about the relationship between local properties AND global structure, Poincaré having intuited that simple connectivity, the property of every loop being contractible to point, might be sufficient to determine topology completely in three dimensions as it is in two, the conjecture's century long resistance to proof demonstrating its profundity, its position among Millennium Prize Problems demonstrating its importance, its solution by Perelman demonstrating his genius, YET the mathematical content however beautiful is penultimate NOT ultimate, is discoverable pattern NOT the Pattern Maker, is logos NOT Logos, is creation NOT Creator, the very topology of simply connected three spheres becoming icon: as simply connected space is one where all loops contract to point, so the soul simplified through nepsis becomes one where all passions contract to single passion for God, as three dimensional sphere's every path returns to origin, so the Christian's every action should proceed from God AND return to God, as Poincaré conjecture asks whether simple connectivity implies spherical topology, so nous purified asks whether single mindedness implies divine union, to whom belongs the simplicity now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The question of what Perelman does in his seclusion, how he spends days in St. Petersburg apartment, whether he continues mathematical research privately OR has abandoned mathematics entirely, whether he prays OR merely broods, whether his solitude is fruitful OR barren, remains unknown because he refuses interviews, avoids contact, guards privacy, the unknowing itself being significant because it prevents either canonization OR condemnation, prevents romanticizing him as saint OR dismissing him as madman, forces us to hold tension between possible interpretations, the tension being healthy because it resists reduction, because it maintains mystery, because it acknowledges that from outside we cannot see inside, that we who know only his public refusals cannot judge his private motivations, that the same action can proceed from opposite sources, that refusing prizes could be humility OR pride, that withdrawal could be asceticism OR bitterness, that silence could be contemplation OR resentment, only God knowing which, only time revealing fruit, only eternity judging correctly, to whom belongs patience now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The larger question Perelman's refusal poses to every Christian intellectual, to every believer working in academy, to every scholar attempting faithfulness in institutions structured around wrong goods, is whether compromise is possible, whether one can participate in academic publishing without being corrupted by it, whether one can receive recognition without recognition receiving one's soul, whether one can work within system while resisting system's deformations, OR whether Perelman's withdrawal represents the only faithful option, whether the academy has become so thoroughly Babylonian that Daniel cannot serve in its courts without contamination, whether Christendom's universities have decayed into anti Christ's corporations requiring exodus NOT reformation, the answer NOT obvious because Scripture contains both Josephs who served Pharaoh AND Moseses who fled Egypt, both Daniels who advised kings AND Jeremiahs who rejected courts, both Pauls who engaged Roman culture AND John Baptists who withdrew to wilderness, the diversity of biblical responses suggesting that God calls different people to different strategies, that some are called to remain AND witness while others are called to depart AND prophesy, that Perelman's path might be right for him while wrong for others OR might be warning to all, to whom belongs calling now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    The possibility that Perelman's withdrawal is NOT asceticism BUT despair, NOT holiness BUT pathology, NOT response to God BUT response to bitterness, must be honestly acknowledged because Orthodox tradition knows the difference between holy hermit AND isolated misanthrope, between St. Anthony radiating joy in Egyptian desert AND Timon of Athens raging in bitter solitude, between withdrawal that bears fruit of love even in seclusion AND withdrawal that bears fruit of resentment festering in isolation, the desert fathers themselves constantly battling the demon of acedia, that spiritual listlessness that is NOT mere sadness BUT profound despair, that temptation unique to those who have withdrawn from world's distractions AND now face themselves AND often find the encounter unbearable, the fathers teaching that solitude magnifies whatever is in the heart: if prayer is in heart then solitude deepens prayer, BUT if bitterness is in heart then solitude deepens bitterness, if love of God motivates withdrawal then isolation increases love, BUT if hatred of humans motivates withdrawal then isolation increases hatred, making Perelman's seclusion potentially dangerous if not oriented toward God, potentially destructive if not accompanied by prayer, potentially damning if motivated by pride, to whom belongs protection now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    AND NOW, in this Liturgy, at this Altar, we are offered the Prize that Perelman's refusal of earthly prizes unknowingly prefigures: the Pearl of Great Price for which the merchant sold everything as Matthew 13:46 relates, the treasure hidden in field for which the finder joyfully sold all he had as Matthew 13:44 records, the one thing needful that Mary chose while Martha worried about many things as Luke 10:42 teaches, because the Body AND Blood we receive are worth more than all Fields Medals AND Millennium Prizes, are more valuable than all academic honors AND earthly recognition, are the reward beyond all rewards, the prize beyond all prizes, the recognition from God that makes human recognition irrelevant, the treasure that makes earthly treasures trash, making Perelman's refusal of million dollars seem almost rational when compared to those who refuse Eucharist for nothing, his rejection of fame seem almost sane when compared to those who reject Christ for anonymity, his withdrawal from mathematical community seem almost justified when compared to those who withdraw from Church for comfort, because if refusing earthly prize for sake of integrity is admirable even when integrity is merely personal ethics, how much more admirable is refusing worldly prizes for sake of heavenly prize? If Perelman could walk away from million dollars because it threatened something he valued more, how much more should we walk away from whatever threatens communion with Christ? If he could resist temptation to be displayed like animal in zoo, how much more should we resist temptation to perform religiosity for human approval?, to whom belongs the true prize now AND ever AND unto ages of ages.

    From Poincaré's conjecture to the Pearl beyond price, from three dimensional topology to the Trinity dwelling in simplicity, from simply connected manifolds to the soul simply connected to God, from Perelman's proof to our confession, from his refusal of Fields Medal to our refusal of world's kingdoms for Christ's kingdom, from his rejection of million dollars to our rejection of mammon for Master, from his withdrawal from mathematical community to our withdrawal from worldly conformity, from his seclusion in St. Petersburg to our seclusion with God in prayer, from his silence before interviewers to our silence before the Most High, from his equations describing three spheres to our prayers ascending to heaven's throne, from Ricci flow smoothing manifolds to grace transfiguring persons, from topology studying shapes of spaces to theology shaping spaces of soul, from mathematical beauty attracting nous to divine Beauty ravishing kardia, from problems solved to mysteries embraced, from proofs completed to faith continued, from theorems demonstrated to trust demonstrated, from Mill
