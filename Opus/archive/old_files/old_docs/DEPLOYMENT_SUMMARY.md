# Theosis

## I. Strategic Role

    The doctrine of Theosis occupies a strategic position within
    the edifice of Orthodox theology, serving not merely as one
    doctrine among many but as a foundational principle illuminating
    the entire economy of salvation. As Saint Athanasius writes in
    his seminal work On the Incarnation, the Logos assumed human
    nature so that humanity might participate in divine life...

[... 10,000+ words continue through all 6 sections ...]

## VI. Orthodox Affirmation

    [... synthesis and culmination ...]
    
    AND NOW, in this Liturgy, at this Altar, where heaven and
    earth are joined, where time and eternity interpenetrate,
    where the Church militant and the Church triumphant unite
    in one great symphony of praise, Theosis is not merely
    remembered but made present, not merely believed but enacted...
    
    [... doxological cascade builds to 150-200 word sentence ...]
    
    Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
    now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.
