## ✅ Q4: "How do I get the expanded version?"

**Answer**: Run these commands in **EXACT ORDER**:

### STEP 1: Generate Expanded Pool

```batch
python subjects_pool_FINAL_EXPANDED.py
```

This creates: `subjects_pool_FINAL_EXPANDED.json` (3,500+ subjects)

### STEP 2: Run Setup

```batch
SETUP_ULTIMATE.bat
```

This will:
- Install dependencies

- Generate entry queue
- Extract golden patterns
- Set up cache
- Validate system

### STEP 3: Test Single Entry

```batch
run_opus.bat "Theosis"
```

### STEP 4: Run Full Batch

```batch
run_final_expanded.bat
```
